# Planets Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the "planets" dataset from Seaborn to understand the characteristics and distribution of exoplanets.
The dataset includes information about various planets discovered in recent years, including their mass, orbital period, and the method used for their detection.

## Dataset
The dataset is loaded from Seaborn's built-in datasets. It contains the following columns:

## planet: Name of the planet.
mass: Mass of the planet in Jupiter masses.
orbital_period: Orbital period of the planet in days.
distance: Distance of the planet from Earth in light-years.
year: Year the planet was discovered.
method: Method used to detect the planet.
